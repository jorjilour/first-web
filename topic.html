            <h2>JSON Definition and its Purpose</h2>

            <p>
                Javascript Object Notation, also known as, JSON, is a lightweight data-interchange format i.e., it is a means to <em>store and exchange information in an organized and easy-to-access 
          manner</em>. JSON is designed in a way where it can display a collection of data as text, although it adapts the Javascript syntax, it can easily be understood or read by humans and easily be parsed and generated by machines as well. As it is
                stored and/or sent as a text, it can effortlessly be sent to and from a server and it can be read and used as a data format by <strong>ANY</strong> programming language, making it <em>language-independent</em>
            </p>

        <section id="origins" class="topic_sect">
            <h2>The JSON Saga</h2>

            <h3>JSON's Origin</h3>
            <p>
                The JSON format was discovered, specified, and popularised by <strong>Douglas Crockford</strong>, along with his <strong>State Software team</strong>, a company he co-founded where he was the CTO at that time.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, Crockford declares that he was not the one who invented this type of format,
            </p>

            <blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C-JoyNuQJs">
                “I do not claim to have invented JSON. It already existed in nature. I do not claim to have been the first to discover it. I found it, named it, and described what it was used for. I gave it a specification and a little website.”
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                The very first JSON message was made in April 2001 embedded in an HTML document.
            </p>


            <p>
                JSON is a standard format: the ECMA-404 The JSON Data Interchange Standard and specified in the domain name he registered, www.jason.org, in 2002. In 2005, the need for an alternative data interchange format to operate smoothly and continuously, during
                the emerging Single Page Applications and modern mobile/web apps, expanded its popularity and boost its usage.
            </p>

            <h3> Why JSON?</h3>

            <h4>JSON Features</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Easy to use</strong> - JSON API offers high-level facade, which helps you to simplify commonly used use-cases.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Performance</strong> - JSON is quite fast as it consumes very less memory space, which is especially suitable for large object graphs or systems.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Free tool</strong> - JSON library is open source and free to use.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Clean JSON</strong> - Creates clean, and compatible JSON result that is easy to read.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Dependency</strong> - JSON library does not require any other library for processing.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>JSON's Growth and Future</h2>

            <p>
                Today, JSON has been adopted by most popular web APIs, like Google, Facebook, and Twitter. JSON has also been widely adopted and questions being asked, have increased in Stack Overflow, a question and answer site for programmers.
            </p>

            <figure>

                <img src="images/jasongraph.PNG" alt="Graph where it shows JSON is frequently used by programmers" />
            </figure>

            <p>
                JSON’s simplicity allowed it to gain rapid popularity as it saves storage space and makes data transfer fast and easy. <br /> In the foreseeing future, it is believed to remain a big player as a data interchanged format. For the time being,
                JSON appears to be the go-to format for communicating with other programs over the internet.

            <h2>Basic Syntax</h2>

            <p>JSON is built on two structures. A collection of data in JSON format may contain: </p>

            <ol id="JSONstructures">
                <li>
                    <p>An object containing a collection of name/value pairs.</p>

                    <p>This object refers to the unordered set of the name/value pairs. This object starts with a left brace “{“ and ends with a right brace “}”. Each name is followed by a colon, “:”and the name/value pairs are separated by a comma, “,”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <code>
                  { “name” : “Jorjilou”, <br />
                  “age” :  22, <br />
                  “nickname” : “Juday”
                </code>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>An ordered list of values stored as an array or a list.</p>

                    <p>An array refers to a collection of values that is ordered. It should begin with a left bracket , “[“ , and end with a right bracket, “]”.
                    </p>

                    <p> For example: the value section from the name/value pair in the object below is an array, which is a collection of numbers. <br /> {"ages":[22,23,24,25,26]}
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p><em>The structures mentioned above can be nested.</em></p>

            <p>A value can either be a <em>string</em> in double quotes, a <em>number</em> (integer, float, digits etc), another <em>object</em> <a href="topic.html#JSONstructures"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, an array, boolean values (true or false), or null.
