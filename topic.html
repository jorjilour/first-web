JSON Definition
Javascript Object Notation, also known as, JSON, is a lightweight data-interchange format i.e., it is a means to store and exchange information in an organized and easy-to-access manner. JSON is designed in a way where it can display a collection of data as text, although it adapts the Javascript syntax, it can easily be understood or read by humans and easily be parsed and generated by machines as well. As it is stored and/or sent as a text, it can effortlessly be sent to and from a server and it can be  read and used as a data format by ANY programming language, making it language-independent.
{ “songs” :
    [
{“id”: 0001,
  “name” : “Fireflies”,
  “singer” : “Owl City”,
  “composer”: “Adam Young”,
  “genre”: [“pop”, “punk”] },
{“id”: 0002,
  “name” : “Hello”,
  “singer” : “Adele”,
  “composer”: “Adele”,
  “genre”: [“pop”] },
    ]
}




JSON Basic Syntax

JSON is built on two structures. A collection of data in JSON format may contain: 
1.	An object containing a collection of name/value pairs. 
2.	An ordered list of values stored as an array or a list.
The structures mentioned above can be nested.
The object mentioned from number 1, refers to the unordered set of the name/value pairs. This object starts with a left brace “{“ and ends with a right brace “}”. Each name is followed by a colon, “:”and the name/value pairs are separated by a comma, “,”.
{ “name” : “Jorjilou”, 
   “age” :  22, 
   “nickname” : “Juday”
}

The array on the other hand, is an collection of values that is ordered. It should begin with a left bracket , “[“ , and end with a right bracket, “]”.
A value can either be a string in double quotes, a number (integer, float, digits etc), another object (number 1), an array, boolean values (true or false), or null.

The JSON Saga and Why JSON?
1)	Who developed it? When? Why? What groups, if any, are responsible for managing it?
The JSON format was discovered, specified, and popularised by Douglas Crockford, along with his State Software team, a company he co-founded.
“I do not claim to have invented JSON. It already existed in nature. I do not claim to have been the first to discover it. I found it, named it, and described what it was used for. I gave it a specification and a little website.”
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#cite_note-Edu4java,_2014-11 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C-JoyNuQJs
The very first JSON message was made in April 2001 embedded in an HTML document.
<html><head><script>
document.domain = ‘fudco.com’ ;
parent.session.receive (
	{to: “session”, do: “test”,
	 text: “Hello World”}
);
</script></head></html>
JSON is a standard format: the ECMA-404 The JSON Data Interchange Standard and specified in the domain name  he registered, www.jason.org, in 2002.  In 2005, the need for an alternative data interchange format to operate smoothly and continuously, during the emerging Single Page Applications and modern mobile/web apps, expanded its popularity and boost its usage.
Why JSON?
Firstly, JSON is simple and easy to learn. When the front-end code is written in Javascript, receiving data in JSON format allows it to load easily and it is also formatted in a more succinct way. This allows for bandwidth to be saved and response times improved when sending messages to and from a server.

2)	Explain its growth or decline. Predict future for the technology?
Today, JSON has been adopted by most popular web APIs, like Google, Facebook, and Twitter. JSON has also been widely adopted and questions being asked, have increased in Stack Overflow, a question and answer site for programmers.
*graph*
JSON’s simplicity allowed it to gain rapid popularity as it makes data transfer easy. In the foreseeing future, it is believed to remain a big player as a data interchanged format. For the time being, JSON appears to be the go-to format for communicating with other programs over the internet.

Comparing and Contrasting with Related Technologies
https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_xml.asp
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#cite_note-Edu4java,_2014-11
Alternative technologies are XML, YAML, CSV etc. In this section, JSON will be compared with XML.
JSON vs XML
Similarities
•	They are both "self describing" (human readable)
•	They are both hierarchical (values within values)
•	They can both be parsed and used by lots of programming languages
•	They can both be fetched with an XMLHttpRequest 
Differences
•	JSON doesn't use end tag
•	JSON is shorter
•	JSON is quicker to read and write
•	JSON can use arrays
•	XML has to be parsed with an XML parser. JSON can be parsed by a standard JavaScript function.
Why JSON is Better Than XML
XML is more difficult to parse than JSON.
JSON is parsed into a ready-to-use JavaScript object.
For AJAX applications, JSON is faster and easier than XML. JSON feeds can be loaded asynchronously much more easily than XML/RSS:
Using XML
•	Fetch an XML document
•	Use the XML DOM to loop through the document
•	Extract values and store in variables
Using JSON
•	Fetch a JSON string
•	JSON.Parse the JSON string




The following JSON and XML examples both define an employees object, with an array of 3 employees:
JSON Example
{"employees":[
  { "firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe" },
  { "firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith" },
  { "firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones" }
]}
XML Example
<employees>
  <employee>
    <firstName>John</firstName> <lastName>Doe</lastName>
  </employee>
  <employee>
    <firstName>Anna</firstName> <lastName>Smith</lastName>
  </employee>
  <employee>
    <firstName>Peter</firstName> <lastName>Jones</lastName>
  </employee>
</employees>
